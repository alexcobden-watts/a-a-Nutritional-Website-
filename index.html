<P>Physical Activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking. Incorporate strength training two to three times weekly to support bone health and metabolism.</P>
<P>Sleep and Hydration: Ensure 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night to allow for cellular repair and cognitive recovery. Drink 6–8 glasses of water daily to maintain energy and digestion.</p>
<P>Mental Well-being: Manage stress through mindfulness, meditation, or hobbies. Strong social connections are also vital for preventing loneliness and cognitive decline. Reduce Saturated Fats and Sugar: Limit intake of sugary drinks, cakes, and fatty meats to lower the risk of heart disease and obesity.</P>
<P>Cut Back on Salt: Keep daily salt intake under 5g (about one teaspoon) to maintain healthy blood pressure.</P>
<p>Avoid Harmful Substances: Stop smoking and limit alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and liver failure.</p>
