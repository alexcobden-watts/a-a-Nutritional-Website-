  <p>Essential Daily Habits</p>
<p>Focus on Fiber: Often called "fibremaxxing" in 2026, the goal is to naturally incorporate at least 30g of fiber daily from beans, oats, and vegetables rather than just supplements.</p>
<P>The "Rainbow" Rule: Instead of counting calories, aim for diversity in color. Try to eat at least one red, green, yellow, orange, blue/purple, and white/brown food daily to ensure a wide range of vitamins and phytonutrients.</P>
<P>>Mindful Eating: Avoid "eating on the run." Turn off screens and chew slowly—it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to send a satiety signal, preventing overeating.</P>
<P>Hydrate Strategically: Drink 6–8 glasses of water daily. A 2026 tip is to drink a glass of water before your morning coffee to set a healthy baseline for the day. Smart Meal Planning</P>
<P>Use Meal Templates: Build your plate using a simple ratio: 1/2 vegetables and fruit, 1/4 whole grains, and 1/4 lean protein.</P>
<P>The "10-Minute Kitchen Reset": Once a week, spend 10 minutes washing and chopping vegetables or prepping a simple protein like hard-boiled eggs or lentils. This reduces "decision fatigue" on busy days.</P>
<P>Plant-Forward Swaps: Increase plant protein by replacing meat in regular recipes with black beans, edamame, or cashews, which are linked to "healthy aging".</P>
<P>Portion Awareness: When eating out, consider ordering smaller dishes or immediately asking for a "to-go" box to save half the meal for later, as restaurant portions are often double the required amount. </P>

<div class="blocks">
  
  <P>Foods you should eat more of to have a healthy diet: </P>
<P>Cruciferous Greens: Broccoli, kale, and spinach for brain and heart health. </P>

<P>Fermented Foods: Brine-pickled vegetables or water kefir (tibicos) for gut probiotics.</P> 

<P>Healthy Fats: Extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, and walnuts.</P>

<P>Whole Grains: Brown rice, quinoa, and oats for sustained energy. </P>
  
</div>

<div class="blocks">
  
    
<p>Foods that you should try and eat less of as for they are not helathy:</p>

<P>Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs): Packaged snacks, deli meats, and sugary cereals. </P>

<p>Free Sugars: Found in sodas, fruit juices, and syrups; limit juice to 150ml/day. </P>

<p>Saturated Fats: Fatty cuts of meat, butter, and lard. </P>

<p>Refined Carbs: White bread, white pasta, and white rice. </P>
